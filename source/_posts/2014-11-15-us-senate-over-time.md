Brett Favre, the man who started in [275 games straight](http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/09/28/eli-manning-milestone/), shaped and influenced the way people reflect on football. Even Bears fans like me acknowledge the superhuman strength and endurance Favre displayed in his years with the NFL. Furthermore, Favre will have a lasting impact on youths who aspire to be quarterbacks. But what about the Senators who have served the United States of America for years on end. Sponsoring bill after bill and pushing for the rights and liberties of the American people. Who were the senators that served the most amount of time, leaving an impact on American politics for years to come?

Below maps out the senators who have served the longest consecutive terms starting with the 80th Congress which was in session from 1947 to 1949. The longer the streak, the longer the time that senator was a senator.

It's immediately evident that incumbents do quite well in the senate; if you've won a few a elections, you'll probably win a few more. Some senators have held their seat for an impressive number of years. Are those that served in congress for the longest number of years truly incredible senators? It's hard to say, but one measure could be to look at the lives they lived and the bills they sponsored.

The first graph below displays the number of bills sponsored per year by each of the top three longest serving senators: Robert Byrd, Edward Kennedy, Daniel Inouye. Also included is the average number of bills sponsored by a senator. The trends are difficult to see due to the noise cauesed by the election cycle. This is what causes the up and down nature of the graph.

The second graph below averages the number of bills passed over a congressional session or a two year time period. This helps reduce the undulation.

Inouye sponsors an impressive number of legislation while Byrd barely ever breaks the average. Kennedy also pushes along a fair number of bills. To note, bills vary drastically in their size and scope -- some bills simply elect a person to a position while others overhaul immigration. 

It's one thing to sponsor a bill; it's quite another thing to get a bill passed. Below inspects how successful each congressman was at passing bills. Again the second graph averages the number of bills passed over two years to stymie the undulation.

These graphs elucidate exactly why Kennedy earned his nickname "The Lion of the Senate." Kennedy, by comparison, pushes heaps of bills through Congress. Inouye is nothing to scoff at either. Again, Byrd lags behind the other two and passes enough bills to be about par for the average senator.

Robert Byrd was born November 17th, 1917. He has held the longest streak as Senator for West Virginia. Byrd's political affiliations and views are nefarious at best; incredibly he was elected 6 times. Byrd, as a youth, is quoted saying:

> "I shall never fight in the armed forces with a negro by my side ... Rather I should die a thousand times, and see Old Glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again, than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels, a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds."

Growing up, Byrd was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Byrd was also a participant in the 83-day filibuster of the Civil Rights Act in 1964. He also opposed the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It's worth noting that he did vote for the Civil Rights Act of 1968. He also is the only senator to vote against both Thurgood Marshall and Clarence Thomas, the only two African-American supreme court nominees. He has repeatedly renounced his past actions in his memoirs. In 1994, Byrd's views began to dramatically change from segragationalist southern democrat to that of a progressive democrat. In the 2003-2004 congressional session the NAACP announced that Byrd's voting record was 100% inline with the NAACP. He even latter pledged $10 million in funding to Martin Luther King Jr.'s National Memorial. It's unclear if Byrd's racial views ever changed or he was in fact simply pandering to the shift in values within the American people. In 2001, he was quoted saying in an interview with Tony Snow about his views on race:

> "They're much, much better than they've ever been in my lifetime ... I think we talk about race too much. I think those problems are largely behind us ... I just think we talk so much about it that we help to create somewhat of an illusion. I think we try to have good will. My old mom told me, 'Robert, you can't go to heaven if you hate anybody.' We practice that. There are white niggers. I've seen a lot of white niggers in my time, if you want to use that word. We just need to work together to make our country a better country, and I'd just as soon quit talking about it so much."
