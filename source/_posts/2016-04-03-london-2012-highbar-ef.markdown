It's 2016 and people are about to start gearing up to watch gymnastics, even men's, in the Olympics. Gymnastics is a confusing sport, especially to those not familiar to all the tricks and flying around. However, it can also be one of the most exciting sports to watch. I decided to highlight this with the 2012 Olympic high bar event finals. This is one of the most thrilling events, and these 8 competitors are the best in the world. I hope those that know nothing about gymnastics will find this somewhat informative, and those that do know a lot about gymnastics find this fun! Here's the full event for reference, no need to watch the entire thing now as I'll break down what's happening.

The video features 6 gymnastics who competed in this order:

1. Danell Leyva (USA)
2. Zou Kai (China, 3rd place)
3. Fabian Hambuchen (Germany, 2nd place)
4. Epke Zonderland (Netherlands, 1st place)
5. Jonathon Horton (USA)
6. Kim Ji-hoon (South Korea)

What made this event so exciting was the level of one-up-manship displayed by Kai, Hambuchen, and Zonderland; each one out did the previous by fractions of a tenth.

### Breaking down a routine

A gymnastics routine is made up of 10 skills. The goal is to compete your hardest 10 skills with the least amount of execution. There are many ways to get a deduction, including bending your legs, flexing your toes, or worst, falling off the equipment. Falling off is damning since it deducts a full point off your score. Your start value is made up of two scores: one for execution, or "how cleanly you did your routine", and the other is for difficult "how hard was your routine". Those two scores make up your final score.

An example of a fall:

#### Execution Score (E Score)

Everyone starts at a 10.0 for their execution score as long as you do at least 7 skills.

#### Difficulty Score (D Score)

There are 5 categories of tricks on each event. You get 0.5 tenths for doing each category. In addition, each trick out of the 10 tricks you do is assigned a value A through G. The higher the letter, the more valuable the trick is:

| Trick | Value |
|-------|-------|
| A     | 0.1|
| B     | 0.2|
| C     | 0.3|
| D     | 0.4|
| E     | 0.5|
| F     | 0.6|
| G     | 0.7|

If I were to do 10 A value skills and fulfill each category, I would receive a 3.5 D score. 2.5 points for fulfiling the categories, and 1 point for the difficulty of my tricks (10 * 0.1).

This would make for a total start value of 13.5, which is abysmal for Olympians, but probably impossibly difficult for those never doing gymnastics.

### Kai

Let's look at Zou Kai, the 3rd place finisher. He has famously difficult routines, mainly for the way he combines tricks together to accumulate bonus. Here's his full set:

Here is his most difficult sequence:

In this sequence, he does 4 tricks in combination: half tak, layout tkachev, rebalco to L grip, layout yaeger. That may sound like gibberish, but the important take away is that he does four tricks that are valued D, D (release move), E, D (release move) which is very difficult. Everytime he does a D trick to a D release move he gains 0.1 bonus. When he goes E trick to a release move, he gets 0.2 in bonus. In total that sequence gets him 0.4 + 0.4 + 0.5 + 0.4, for the values of the tricks, plus 0.3 in bonus to come to a total of 1.7!

### Hambuchen
