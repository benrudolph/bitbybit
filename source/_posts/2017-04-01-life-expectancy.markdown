Money, in many ways, gives power. However, in a new study, data shows that money also gives us longer life. And in some parts of the US it's a difference of over 10 years.

In the above graph, the y-axis contains the life expectancy for top quartile earners, while the x-axis is the life expectancy for bottom quartile earners. Each dot represents a county in the United States. The closer a dot is to the diagonal line, the closer that county is to having a life expectancy uneffected by income.

Below is a comparison of California to Texas. California, despite its large population, has one of the most equitable balance in life expectancy. Texas, another populous state, struggles to have equality in life expectancy. Howard, Texas is home to one of the largest disparities in life expectancy. Those living in Howard, Texas who earn in the bottom quartile, can expect to live 14.45 years less than their counterparts in the top quartile.

When making this graph, I had hypothesized that democratic counties would have less of an imbalance between life expectancy than the republican counties, likely due to my own personal biases. I thought policies on health care, and minimum wage would tip the scales in favor of the blue states. It turns that blue counties _do_ have a slightly better equality in life expectancy. However, this is only _correlation_ and not causation. There can, and most likely are, many other factors that contribute to the difference. Nevertheless, it's still interesting to examine.

Blue county top quartile earners live on average **6.61 years** longer than their bottom quartile counterparts. Red counties, in contrast, live **7.12 years** longer.

More striking is the difference between men and women. Female top quartile earners live **5.50 years** longer than the bottom quartile; however, male top quartile earners live **8.55 years** longer than the bottom quartile. Males are hit harder by income inequality.

The above graph highlights Hawaii as being the state where income makes the least amount of impact on life expectancy, while Washington DC and Wyoming have the greatest inequality.
