Learning a new language is tough. After ping ponging around from French to German and then back to French again. I questioned whether it was worth the time investment to actually learn a new language. If you're like me, language is a vehicle of communication and the more people that can understand you the better. As the late, great Nelson Mandela once said:

"If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart."

I've always wondered what the best language to learn was. I've always had it in my head that Spanish was the language that I "should" learn, but being somewhat of a contrarian I always refused to go down the dogmatic path. Granted the "best" language is certainly subjective depending on tastes and goals in life, but below is my data-driven and heartfelt process of deciding on a new language to learn. Hopefully the numbers will point me to an undenible choice.

### Most spoken languages

As an easy start, I analyzed which languages were spoken most frequently. As mentioned before, being able to communicate with more people is a big factor for me.
