I recently moved from Cambridge to San Francisco. I knew that San Francisco was more expensive than Cambridge, but I figured it couldn't be that much worse than Cambridge.

Great. San Francisco is outrageously expensive. Salaries are higher in SF though (graph); it's possible that that could make up for some of the difference.

Do these high rent price though translate to space. Where can you go to get the most bang for your buck?
