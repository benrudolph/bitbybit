In a movement to open up its data, Chicago has released all of its crime data from 2001 until present. This dataset, over 6 gigabytes, certainly shows some fascinating, if not downright scary, trends in crime in the city of Chicago.

In this dataset, one field is particularly curious. Each row in the database is a crime that has been reported to Chicago. It defines then whether that report has led to an arrest.

{% include posts/chicago/arrest_ratio.html %}

Taking a close look into this, immediately there are some alarming facts. Of all the criminal sexual crimes reported, a mere 17% led to arrests. Contrast that with prostitution -- 99% of all reports on prostitution lead to arrest. Arrest rates for criminal sexual assault are on par with crimes such as intimidation and stalking.

How does Chicago define criminal sexual assault?

> Any sexual act directed against another person, forcibly and/or against that person's will or not forcibly or against the person's will in instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent

In addition many of the incidents have been subdivided further. [Cases that use an assault weapon]?

Digging a bit deaper into the over 20,000 criminal sexual assault cases reported since 2001, I looked into where these cases were happening, and how likely an arrest was to occur.

{% include posts/chicago/arrest_ratio_by_location.html %}

Out of 167 reported incidents of criminal sexual assault that occurred in hospital buildings, a mere 3 led to arrests. Combine that with the reports in nursing homes, 128, in which 8 led to arrests. So, theoritically, you have a __3.7%__ of being arrested if you commit criminal sexual assualt in a nursing home or hospital! (Assuming that all reported incidents are truthful). I was shocked when I saw these numbers; unfortunately it only gets worse. Later you will see why 3.7% is a gross overestimate and the actual number is most likely much lower.

### It gets worse

I called Tracy Siska who heads the [Chicago Justice Project](http://chicagojustice.org/) and has written a [wonderful report](http://www.chicagojustice.org/research/long-form-reports/felony-sex-crime-case-processing-report-analysis-recommendations/CJP_Felony_Sex_Crime_Case_Processing_Report_Analys.pdf) that details this issue in further depth. It turns out looking at incidents to arrests is only the __very tip of the iceberg__. 

When examining incidents that lead to arrests, it's similar to analyzing [some parallel process]. The machine that convicts a man or woman of criminal sexual assault is a long process and at each stage an astounding number of perpetrators evade justice. The process is quite complex and Siska's report details it more fully, but I've tried to break it down in the simplist terms possible.

[Flow chart]

In Chicago, there's a 5 step process to reach the criminal court.

1. Assault - this is the initial assault. A large number of cases at this stage do not continue due to the victim __choosing not to report the case__. If the case is reported, the process continues.
2. Initial Response - The Chicago Police Department sends an officer to interviews the victim. __If the officer decides the case is not worth pursuing, no report is generated and the investigation is dropped__. It is important to note that a single individual is responsible at this point for deciding to continue the case. If deemed by the officer, a report will be written to classify the crime as a felony sex crime (criminal sexual assault) and the process will move along.
3. Detective Investigation
4. Felony Review
5. Cook County Criminal Court

Data at all these stages is sparse and often does not mesh well together. However, it is easy to say that very few reports actually lead to time in jail.

### Why

It is a bit perplexing that 99.6% of the 64,547 incidents of prositution lead to arrest where criminal sexual assault has an arrest rate of 17%. To investigate further, below is a few maps that could potentially point to causation or correlation to low arrest ratios.

{% include posts/chicago/ca.html %}

There is some immediate correlations that stand out. Unsurprisingly, the areas with the highest income are areas where the arrest rate is the lowest for criminal sexual assault. Areas where sexual assault is more common per person the arrest ratio is also later. One theory that explains this could be that since the crime is more widespread it has become more of the norm rather than an egregrious crime and thus is not taken as seriously.

Besides socio-economic and race factors, there are a number of other theories as to why so few assaults lead to arrest.

#### He-Said She-Said
A lot of cases end up being the man's word against the woman's word. These cases do not hold up well in court and since prosecutors want winnable cases, many are often dropped. Further exacerbating the issue is the fact that victims are often viewed incredulously. The [National Center for the Prosecution of Violence Against Women](http://www.ndaa.org/pdf/the_voice_vol_3_no_1_2009.pdf) purports that in one study 41% of 109 sexual assault cases were deemed false. In reality, they suggest that only 2-8% of reports are actually false.

#### Power dynamics
Another possible reason for this gross disparity in arresting sex offenders is that there is often a dependency relationship between the man and the woman. Of the 20,378 criminal sexual assault cases, 12% (or 2,438) of them were domestic. If the woman is in a position where she depends on the man for money or something else, she now in an extremely tricky position. If she reports and the man is sent to jail, now she is left to fend for herself and possibly a child. If she reports and the man *isn't* sent to jail, then she can find herself in a more dangerous situation. In this situation there isn't much incentive to pursure arrest in either scenario.

#### Victim blaming
In this case, victims doubly suffer from a sexual assault. Not only have they been subjected to an extremely traumatic event, they are also held responsible for the crime. For example, phrases like these, "She was asking to be raped because of the skirt she was wearing." engenders these kinds of attitudes. For obvious reasons, this can deter motivation of pursuing a sexual assault case.

#### Misogny
A vast majority of cops today are male. As of 2013, only 13% of the US policeforce is female. Men can potentially exhibit unknowing bias to downright misogyny towards victims. Many of the steps that lead to arrest often rely on one person, so having this large gender disparity could affect the number reports that lead to arrest.

There are many other compounding factors that contribute to this mess. Instead of exhuastively listing out the countless reasons why women are incessently subjugated, I'd like to also highlight a few examples where things did works and things that might work.

### How can we fix this?
