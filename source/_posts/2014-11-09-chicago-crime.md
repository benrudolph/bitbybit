The term "rape culture" has long been part of the American vocabulary, dating back to [1970](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_culture#cite_note-Smith2004-11). However, in recent years, it has blown up on the web:

It's proved to be an extremely divisive issue with people arguing that it permeates [every aspect of American culture](http://www.thenation.com/blog/172024/americas-rape-problem-we-refuse-admit-there-one) and those who claim it's a bunch of [overblown hype](http://time.com/30545/its-time-to-end-rape-culture-hysteria/). Both articles actually make very valid points. However they do not delve into the data behind the issue (partially due to the lack of data) and rely more on anecdotal events. I decided to take a dive into what data we do have to discover if it is possible to empirically  come to some conclusions about rape culture. I'll be using the following definition from the World Heritage Encyclopedia of "rape culture" 

> Rape culture is a concept which links rape and sexual violence to the culture of a society, and in which prevalent attitudes and practices normalize, excuse, tolerate, and even condone rape

Instead of fixating on the entire United States, I shifted focus to the city of Chicago. Chicago recently released 6 GB of crime data â€“ every crime reported from 2001 until today. Each report comes with a type: theft, prostitution, stalking, to name a few. The report also notes whether that reported crime led to an arrest. In addition, there's other interesting meta data, including location and date. I used this data to judge to what degree of tolerance the city of Chicago has towards rape. Specifically I analyzed Criminal Sexual Assault (CSA), which the Chicago police department (CPD) defines as:

> Any sexual act directed against another person, forcibly and/or against that person's will or not forcibly or against the person's will in instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent.

This isn't a perfect proxy for rape culture per se, but I hold that **it represents how the acceptance of rape has subtly seeped into our judicial system**. Rape is an act committed by a minority of people and affects a minority of the population (estimates show that approximately 0.3% of women in Chicago experience rape each year). Rape culture purports that rape is something that has become accepted by all of society; that is not something I can even come close to proving.

To begin this analysis on how CSA cases manifest themselves in the judicial system, I viewed CSA in context to other crimes. How does CSA hold up in terms of arrest rate, that is, what percentage of reports lead to arrest.

{% include posts/chicago/arrest_ratio.html %}

The graph above shows the arrest ratio over the past 14 years for each type of crime. CSA hovers around 17%, next to stalking and intimidation. Contrast that with crimes related to prostitution, liquor law violation and narcotics, a 99% arrest ratio. That's a pretty extraordinary number if you think about it. Nearly all reports lead to an arrest. How can it be that the CPD shows such vigor to arrest pot dealers (yes, marijuana is a [schedule 1 narcotic](http://www.drugs.com/article/csa-schedule-1.html)), yet barely arrests 15% of CSA reports?

The way CSA manifests itself in the city is also noteworthy. Each report comes with a location descriptor. Did the crime happen in a house, or on a street? Below shows where CSA is happening.

{% include posts/chicago/arrest_ratio_by_location.html %}

CSA often occurs by people known to the victim (need citation). It's no surprise to see many of the cases in a home or apartment. It still seems inexcusable though that only 20% percent of CSA reports in a residence or apartment lead to an arrest.

At the very right of the graph, notice that 1.8% of CSA reports occurring in a hospital lead to arrest. Over the past 14 years there have been 168 reports; 3 led to an arrest. First, wow. Second, that's a nontrivial amount of reports. How does that happen in a place that is supposed to be safe, a refuge?

Trying to wrestle with this, I talked with Margaret Bassett from the University of Texas at Austin. [what does Bassett do?]. I posed to her this very question. How is it that hospitals are experiencing so many reports of CSA? The answer is logical; predators often target those that are vulnerable making hospitals ripe for CSA. Still, it doesn't explain why only 3 people were arrested.

Right. So we've established that the arrest ratio for CSA reports is at the very least odd, if not mind boggling. The question of "why" has weighed heavily on me throughout this entire exercise, but maybe these numbers aren't terribly shocking to you. Let's look at a more complete picture of this.

Thus far, this article has focused on arrest ratio because the city of Chicago has solid data about it. But this is only a small piece of the much larger picture to hold an assailant responsible for his/her crime. Tracy Siska, who works at an organization called The Chicago Justice project, has become very familiar with the Chicago criminal justice system. He knows the weaknesses in the system and has written up an excellent report about it [here](http://www.chicagojustice.org/research/long-form-reports/felony-sex-crime-case-processing-report-analysis-recommendations/CJP_Felony_Sex_Crime_Case_Processing_Report_Analys.pdf). In the most basic terms, the process looks something like this:

1. Victim is assaulted
2. Victim decides wether to report the crime
3. Report leads to an arrest
4. Assailant is prosecuted and a trial is conducted
5. Assailant is sentenced to jail

In each one of these steps the assailant has a very high chance of getting released. Siska meticulously documents each step of process, noting where the process is reliant on a single person to push the case forward. Unfortunately the numbers on these other parts of the system are a bit harder to grapple with. How do you count the number of unreported CSA? And the Chicago justice system doesn't release information about CSA trials, so it's impossible to know how many arrested actually were convicted. Siska's report attempted to unearth the data behind number of CSAs happening versus the number of CSAs reporting. To be clear, that's the number that determines step 1 to step 2 above. Siska uses numbers from the 2006 Kilpatrick study that finds that .74% of all women experienced a complete rape. That translates to approximately 8,141 women (18 or older) raped in Chicago, based on the 2000 population of Chicago. In 2001, there were 1,792 reports of CSA. Of those, 414 led to an arrest. In sum:

We've only estimated for three of the steps and already 95% of assailants walk freely. RAINN has an [infographic](https://rainn.org/get-information/statistics/reporting-rates) depicting this very concept. Unfortunately, the computations and methodology that RAINN used to get to those numbers leaves something to be desired.

Siska and I had an interesting conversation revolving around what causes this sort of systemic issue. Like most complex problems, there are a lot of reasons. It's out of scope to talk about them all, but I again encourage that you read the report as it details all the points in the system where the outcome of the assailant being held accountable is in the hands of one person.

Does this make analysis of reports leading to arrest misleading? Only slightly. It is still an integral part of the machine and an important indicator for attitudes towards CSA. I wanted to lead my own data driven analysis for causes of such low arrest ratios. I tried to link this anomalous issue with demographic trends.

{% include posts/chicago/ca.html %}


One correlation that can be seen on these maps is that high income signals low arrest rates. Along the coast of Lake Michigan, it is clear that the income levels are substantially higher than anywhere else in the city. When you look at the same area in the arrest ratio map, you see low arrest rates. One explanation is that rich people often get the benefit of the doubt. Below is a image that highlights this concept:

![High incomes equals low arrest ratio](/images/chicago/high_income_low_arrests.png)

More interesting is the correlation between the number of reports and arrest ratio. In the map depicting the number reports per 100 residents, it's clear that the southside of Chicago has far more reports of CSA than the rest of the city. Yet, the arrest ratio in that same area is average or below average in each of those community areas. The number of reports per person could make it more difficult to make arrests, resulting in a lower arrest ratio.

These correlations could give us insight into which areas need more attention from the city of Chicago.

Perhaps, through this analysis, we've been unfair to Chicago. I've been aggregating the data from 2001 to 2014. 2001 was a long time ago. The backstreet boys were popular, and I had no armpit hair. Maybe through the course of 14 years Chicago has begun to change, reverse its old ways. Here is the data broken down by year.

{% include posts/chicago/assaults_overtime.html %}

From 2001 to 2014, reports of CSA have actually decreased. (Ref HRW report). Superficially, this seems positive. A sign that CSA is decreasing. I argue the opposite for a few reasons. First note how the arrest ratio has actually declined over the past decade. That means less reports actually lead to arrest. This could potentially have a toll on the city. Victims begin to lose faith in the justice system, so they simply stop reporting. A decrease in reports shows that Chicago is actually getting worse at reporting of CSA.

Looking at this data, it's hard to convince anyone that the judicial system is working in favor of CSA victims. Indeed, rape, while most likely non-intentionally, has found a way to avoid the grips of justice. [more on this]
